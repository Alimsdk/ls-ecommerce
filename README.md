# Shoe selling Ecommerce Site using local storage

I created a site which sells shoes ! For frontend, I used ReactJS ! I used Local Storage as Database !! Here A user can add to cart their favourite items and It will be saved on Local storage so even if you reload the data won't be disappeared !

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
